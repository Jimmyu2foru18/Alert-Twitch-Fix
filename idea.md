🗺️ Project 
✅ Goal
Build an Streamlabs OBS plugin that:

Embeds its own Chromium browser instance

Keeps the Chromium browser rendering and executing JavaScript continuously, even when the OBS preview is minimized or obscured

Feeds its rendered textures to a standard OBS source so they appear on stream

Allows audio to play back even if the preview stops

🧩 Components
1️⃣ Plugin Base
Built in C++

Uses the official OBS Studio plugin API

Follows the standard .dll plugin packaging

Hooks into OBS as a new source type (like a custom browser source)

2️⃣ Embedded Browser
Use CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework), same as OBS does, but:

Customize CEF initialization to disable “background throttling”

There are CEF flags (like --disable-background-timer-throttling, --disable-renderer-backgrounding) to keep Chromium active even when hidden.

You could also subclass CEF’s life-cycle hooks to force repaint even when offscreen.

3️⃣ Texture Rendering
Use OBS’s graphics API (GS — Graphics Subsystem) to:

Take the rendered Chromium content (which will be a buffer)

Push it to a GS texture

Display it as part of the OBS video pipeline

OBS provides a hook to register a custom texture source

4️⃣ Audio Routing
Allow your plugin to capture audio from Chromium

Route that audio directly through the OBS audio subsystem

This way even if the preview is covered, the audio continues, since it’s processed outside the OBS preview

5️⃣ Settings UI
Provide a small config panel within OBS’s source properties

URL to load

Volume

Possibly reload controls

Checkbox for “force continuous playback”

Other options

🛠️ Technical Breakdown
Step	What you’ll need
OBS plugin skeleton	OBS Plugin SDK (CMake-based), C++17, build environment for Windows/Linux
Chromium integration	CEF binary, built or bundled, with background throttling overrides
Texture handling	GS functions in OBS (obs_source_frame, gs_texture_create, etc.)
Audio hook	Port Chromium’s audio output to an OBS audio source
UI controls	OBS uses Qt for its properties panels — integrate with the plugin’s property definitions
Deployment packaging	CMake scripts to build .dll for Windows
Testing	Test in latest OBS Studio, optionally in Streamlabs Desktop since it’s compatible with OBS plugin system

🚧 Potential Challenges
✅ CEF is huge — you will have to ship a ~200–300 MB Chromium binary with your plugin
✅ OBS’s render loop is very tightly optimized — your custom source needs to be efficient
✅ Handling audio routing from CEF to OBS’s audio subsystem takes some glue code
✅ Building OBS plugins on Windows requires Visual Studio (or clang-cl) + CMake
✅ You must handle cross-platform differences if you ever want macOS or Linux (start with Windows first)

🎯 Next Steps
✅ 1. I’ll help you scaffold the plugin skeleton with the OBS SDK
✅ 2. We integrate CEF and prove that we can render a webpage into a GS texture
✅ 3. We override CEF throttling flags so it never pauses
✅ 4. We wire up audio capture
✅ 5. Build the UI property page
